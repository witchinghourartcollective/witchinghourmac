# Ritual 001 — Invocation

## Purpose
To initialize a Witching Hour project so that intent, identity,
and execution remain aligned over time.

This ritual is performed at the beginning of a project
or when a system has been rebuilt from instability.

## When to Perform
- After infrastructure is stable
- Before public launch or relaunch
- When meaning has drifted from execution

## Materials
- A single sigil (canonical form)
- A clean repository state
- A deployable artifact (site, release, or system)

## Steps
1. Establish the spine
   - Confirm the Codex exists on disk
   - Confirm version control is active

2. Place the sigil
   - The sigil must be rendered without distortion
   - Color and scale may change; geometry may not

3. Name the work
   - Declare the project name plainly
   - Avoid modifiers, slogans, or hype

4. Deploy once
   - Build must pass locally
   - Build must pass in production
   - No iteration during the ritual

5. Record
   - Commit the state
   - Do not amend the commit
   - Note the date and context

## Completion
The ritual is complete when:
- The artifact is publicly reachable
- The sigil is visible
- The Codex records the event

## Notes
This ritual is not symbolic.
It is a system reset that restores coherence.
