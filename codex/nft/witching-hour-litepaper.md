# Witching Hour

## What It Is
Witching Hour is a creative studio and collective operating at the intersection of music, visual art, and technology. NFTs function as keys—granting access, not promises.

## Philosophy
Creative value over speculation.
Access over hype.
Participation over passive ownership.

## Structure
Witching Hour releases are tiered, intentional, and finite.

### Drops
- Genesis — 333 @ 0.0333 ETH
- Alignment — 777 @ 0.0777 ETH
- Ritual — 666 @ 0.0666 ETH
- Completion — 999 @ 0.0999 ETH
- Frequency — 369 @ 0.0369 ETH (experimental)

Each drop is a standalone Zora collection on Base.

## Utilities
Holders gain access to exclusive music, visual art, studio sessions, collaborations, physical drops, and experimental releases depending on tier.

## Community
Access is gated, not gamified.
Participation is optional, not required.
Value is delivered through creation.

## Closing
Witching Hour is not a trend.
It is a practice.
