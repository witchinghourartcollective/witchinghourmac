## Mint Page Paragraphs

**Genesis — 333 @ 0.0333 ETH**
Genesis holders form the foundation of Witching Hour. This tier grants early and priority access to music releases, private studio content, and future collaborations. Genesis keys are limited, permanent, and tied to the project’s origin—designed for those who enter before the doors open wider.

**Alignment — 777 @ 0.0777 ETH**
Alignment expands the circle. Holders gain access to ongoing releases, collaborations, physical drops, and select creative opportunities as Witching Hour grows. This tier represents momentum—where the project is active, visible, and evolving in real time.

**Ritual — 666 @ 0.0666 ETH**
Ritual is the edge layer. This tier unlocks experimental releases, alternate art, behind-the-scenes process, and invite-only creative moments. It is intentionally selective and not designed for mass participation. Access is granted by intent, not hype.

**Completion — 999 @ 0.0999 ETH**
Completion is the open gate. Holders gain long-term access to the Witching Hour ecosystem, including music, art, and future utilities. This tier allows broader participation while preserving the integrity of earlier keys.

**Frequency — 369 @ 0.0369 ETH (Special Drop)**
Frequency is a transmission. Utilities, timing, and format vary per release. No roadmap, no guarantees—only signal. This tier exists for experimentation across sound, symbol, and technology.

## Descriptions

### Platform-safe (launchpads / curators)

Witching Hour is a creative studio and collective using NFTs as a membership and access layer. The project focuses on music, visual art, and collaborative experiences, offering holders exclusive content, early access, and participation in a long-term creative ecosystem.

### Uncensored (site / Discord / lore)

Witching Hour exists at the intersection of sound, symbol, and intention. Each drop is a key—some open doors, some unlock rooms, some are meant only for those willing to go deeper. This is not speculation. This is access.
