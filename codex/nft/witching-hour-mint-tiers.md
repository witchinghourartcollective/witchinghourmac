# Witching Hour — Launchpad + Business Form Answers

Below is exact copy-paste text for each field, tuned for Witching Hour in clear, credible language.

## Project Name

Witching Hour: Art, Music & Utility NFTs

(Short, clean, sounds intentional.)

## Project Description (Elevator Pitch)

Witching Hour is a creative studio and collective blending music, visual art, and technology. The NFT collection functions as a membership and utility layer, granting holders access to exclusive music releases, studio sessions, digital art, physical drops, and collaborative opportunities. The project focuses on long-term creative value rather than short-term speculation.

## Which chain is going to be used for issuing NFTs?

Base (Ethereum L2)
(If Base is in the dropdown, choose it. If not, choose Ethereum and clarify Base in utilities if needed.)

## Twitter Link

Use your strongest, most active account. If it’s not “perfect,” that’s fine.

Example:

https://twitter.com/witchinghourmac

(or your main personal account if that’s where engagement actually is)

## Team

Founder & Creative Director:

Fletcher Vaughn (aka Fletch)
Twitter: https://twitter.com/[yourhandle]
LinkedIn: N/A

Collaborators are project-based artists and producers contributing to music, visual art, and development.

(Simple > bloated.)

## Roadmap / Past Milestones

Past

- Built an engaged cross-platform creative audience
- Developed initial NFT concepts and artwork

Upcoming

## Key Partners / Relationship with Them

Independent artists, producers, and visual creators collaborating on music releases, artwork, and live or digital experiences. Partnerships are creator-driven and evolve per project.

(Translation: real humans, not fake VC buzzwords.)

## Influencers Onboard

Early support from independent artists and creators within music and digital art communities. Influencer partnerships will be organic and utility-focused rather than paid hype campaigns.

(This is a safe, honest answer.)
