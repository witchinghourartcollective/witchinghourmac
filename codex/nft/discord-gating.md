# Witching Hour — Discord Role-Based Gating

Goal: Token = role = access.

## Roles

- 🜁 Genesis (333)
- 🜂 Alignment (777)
- 🜃 Ritual (666)
- 🜄 Completion (999)
- ⟁ Frequency (369)

## Channel Mapping

- #genesis → Genesis+
- #alignment → Alignment+
- #ritual → Ritual only
- #announcements → All holders
- #frequency → Frequency role only

## Gating Tool (recommended)

Collab.Land or Guild.xyz

## Chain

Base

## Contracts

Zora collections

## Logic

- Hold Genesis → auto-assign Genesis role
- Hold multiple → highest tier role wins (optional)

This scales cleanly as you add drops. No rewiring later.
