# Witching Hour - Discord Role-Based Gating

Goal: token = role = access.

## Roles

- 🜁 Genesis (333)
- 🜂 Alignment (777)
- 🜃 Ritual (666)
- 🜄 Completion (999)
- ⟁ Frequency (369)

## Channel mapping

- #genesis -> Genesis+
- #alignment -> Alignment+
- #ritual -> Ritual only
- #announcements -> All holders
- #frequency -> Frequency role only

## Gating tool (recommended)

Collab.Land or Guild.xyz

## Chain

Base

## Contracts

Zora collections

## Logic

- Hold Genesis -> auto-assign Genesis role
- Hold multiple -> highest tier role wins (optional)

This scales cleanly as you add drops. No rewiring later.
