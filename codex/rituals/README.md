# Rituals Codex

Rituals are repeatable processes used in Witching Hour work.
They are not superstition — they are structure.

A ritual can be:
- a release process
- a wallet-creation sequence
- a collaboration method
- a production workflow
- a personal reset

Each ritual should answer:
1. When is it used?
2. What steps are performed?
3. What changes after completion?
