# Rituals Codex

Rituals are repeatable processes used in Witching Hour work.
They are not superstition - they are structure.

A ritual can be:

- A release process
- A wallet-creation sequence
- A collaboration method
- A production workflow
- A personal reset

Each ritual should answer:

1. When is it used?
2. What steps are performed?
3. What changes after completion?
