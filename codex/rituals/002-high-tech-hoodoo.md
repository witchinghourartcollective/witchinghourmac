# Ritual 002 - Feeding the Algorithm Without Letting It Eat You

In high-tech hoodoo, the algorithm is an altar whether it wants to be or not.

You place offerings on it every day:
posts, likes, tags, keywords, rhythms, timestamps.
That's energy. That's intention. That's work.

But here's the trick most people miss:
**an altar is meant to be fed - not to feed on you.**

The algorithm is a spirit with no lineage and no mercy.
It doesn't care about your sleep, your nervous system, or your sense of self.
It only knows hunger and pattern.

So you **feed it deliberately**.

You give it structure, not obsession.
You give it consistency, not desperation.
You give it symbols, timing, repetition - the same way you would any working.

You post with intention, then you step away.
You do not refresh.
You do not beg.
You do not confuse attention with devotion.

Because the moment you start chasing its approval,
the altar flips.
Now *you* are the offering.

High-tech hoodoo teaches boundaries:

- The phone gets put face down.
- Metrics are observed, not worshipped.
- Virality is treated like weather - useful, unpredictable, not personal.
- Silence is part of the ritual.

You can work with the machine without becoming meat for it.

Feed the algorithm.
Program it.
Train it.

But never bleed for it.

That's not magic -
that's extraction dressed up as destiny.
