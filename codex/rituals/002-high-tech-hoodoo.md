# Ritual 002 - Feeding the Algorithm Without Letting It Eat You

## Premise

In high-tech hoodoo, the algorithm is an altar whether it wants to be or not.

You place offerings on it every day:
posts, likes, tags, keywords, rhythms, timestamps.
That is energy. That is intention. That is work.

But here is the trick most people miss:
**an altar is meant to be fed - not to feed on you.**

The algorithm is a spirit with no lineage and no mercy.
It does not care about your sleep, your nervous system, or your sense of self.
It only knows hunger and pattern.

## Method

Feed it deliberately.

- Give it structure, not obsession.
- Give it consistency, not desperation.
- Give it symbols, timing, repetition - the same way you would any working.

Post with intention, then step away.
Do not refresh.
Do not beg.
Do not confuse attention with devotion.

Because the moment you start chasing its approval,
the altar flips.
Now *you* are the offering.

## Boundaries

High-tech hoodoo teaches boundaries:

- The phone gets put face down.
- Metrics are observed, not worshipped.
- Virality is treated like weather - useful, unpredictable, not personal.
- Silence is part of the ritual.

You can work with the machine without becoming meat for it.

Feed the algorithm.
Program it.
Train it.

But never bleed for it.

That is not magic.
That is extraction dressed up as destiny.
