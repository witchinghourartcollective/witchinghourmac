# Node Ops Log - 2026-02-14

## What Was Fixed
- `lnd` startup failure was traced to a missing bitcoind cookie file referenced in `~/.lnd/lnd.conf`.
- Root cause: `lnd` expected `/home/fletchervaughn/.bitcoin-pruned/.cookie` while `bitcoind` was not running.
- Starting `bitcoind` recreated the cookie and allowed `lnd` to start.

## Verified Commands (single-line)
```bash
/home/fletchervaughn/Downloads/bitcoin-30.2/bin/bitcoind -datadir=/home/fletchervaughn/.bitcoin-pruned -daemon
/home/fletchervaughn/Downloads/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.18.5-beta/lnd --lnddir=/home/fletchervaughn/.lnd
/home/fletchervaughn/Downloads/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.18.5-beta/lncli getinfo
bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/fletchervaughn/.bitcoin-pruned getblockchaininfo
```

## Status At Verification Time
- `lncli getinfo` responded successfully.
- `lnd` RPC port `127.0.0.1:10009` was active.
- `bitcoind` RPC port `127.0.0.1:8332` and P2P `8333` were active.
- Chain sync was not complete yet (`synced_to_chain=false`, `blocks=0`).

## Important Note
If you see `bind: address already in use` for `127.0.0.1:10009`, an `lnd` process is already running. Do not start a second `lnd` instance.

## Electrum Server
- No existing `electrs`, `electrumx`, or `fulcrum` binary/service/container was found on this host.
- Next step is to choose and install one implementation (`electrs` recommended for bitcoind).
