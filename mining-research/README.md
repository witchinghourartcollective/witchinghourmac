# Mining Research

Notes and experiments for learning Bitcoin mining on local hardware and HiveOS.

## Scope

- Local hardware benchmarking (CPU/GPU/ASIC)
- HiveOS configuration notes
- Pool and payout comparisons

## Log template

Capture each experiment in a short note with:

- Date
- Hardware (CPU/GPU/ASIC model)
- Hashrate and power draw
- Electricity rate ($/kWh)
- Pool + stratum endpoint
- Results and takeaways

## TODO

- Record hardware details (CPU/GPU/ASIC model, hashrate, power draw).
- Record electricity rate ($/kWh) and location for latency.
- Evaluate pools (fees, payout methods, stratum endpoints).
- Document HiveOS flight sheet setup.
