# Mining Research

Notes and experiments for learning Bitcoin mining on local hardware and HiveOS.

## TODO
- Record hardware details (CPU/GPU/ASIC model, hashrate, power draw).
- Record electricity rate ($/kWh) and location for latency.
- Evaluate pools (fees, payout methods, stratum endpoints).
- Document HiveOS flight sheet setup.
