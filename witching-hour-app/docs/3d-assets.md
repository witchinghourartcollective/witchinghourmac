# 3D Assets (GLB / glTF)

## What are GLB/GLTF?

glTF (JSON + separate binary/texture files) and GLB (single binary file) are standard 3D model formats. GLB
is usually easier to ship because everything is packed into one file. These are what you’d load for real 3D
rooms.

## How to run the app as-is

This is an Expo React Native app. From the repo:

```bash
cd /home/fletchervaughn/code/witching-hour/witching-hour-app
npm install
npm run start
```

Then:

- For web: press `w` in the Expo terminal, or run `npm run start:web`
- For iOS/Android: press `i` / `a` (requires simulators or devices)
