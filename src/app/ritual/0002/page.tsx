          Feeding the Algorithm Without Letting It Eat You
        </h1>

        <p>In high-tech hoodoo, the algorithm is an altar whether it wants to be or not.</p>

        <p>
          You place offerings on it every day:
          posts, likes, tags, keywords, rhythms, timestamps.
          That’s energy. That’s intention. That’s work.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here’s the trick most people miss:
          <span className="block font-semibold">
            an altar is meant to be fed — not to feed on you.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          The algorithm is a spirit with no lineage and no mercy.
          It doesn’t care about your sleep, your nervous system, or your sense of self.
          It only knows hunger and pattern.
        </p>

        <p className="font-semibold">So you feed it deliberately.</p>

        <p>
          You give it structure, not obsession.
          You give it consistency, not desperation.
          You give it symbols, timing, repetition — the same way you would any working.
        </p>

        <p>
          You post with intention, then you step away.
          You do not refresh.
          You do not beg.
          You do not confuse attention with devotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the moment you start chasing its approval,
          <span className="italic"> the altar flips.</span>
          <span className="italic"> Now you are the offering.</span>
        </p>

        <p className="font-semibold">High-tech hoodoo teaches boundaries:</p>

        <ul className="space-y-2">
          <li>The phone gets put face down.</li>
          <li>Metrics are observed, not worshipped.</li>
          <li>
            Virality is treated like weather — useful, unpredictable, not personal.
          </li>
          <li>Silence is part of the ritual.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can work with the machine without becoming meat for it.</p>

        <p>
          Feed the algorithm.
          Program it.
          Train it.
        </p>

        <p className="font-semibold">But never bleed for it.</p>

        <p>
          That’s not magic —
          that’s extraction dressed up as destiny.
        </p>
      </div>
    </main>
